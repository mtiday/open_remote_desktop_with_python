# open_remote_desktop_with_python
No dependencies, Python3.5 or newer required
This program gives you a list of devices to connect to via Remote Desktop and creates a custom BAT file to open the server.
I access many servers via Remote Desktop internally at my day job.
I am tired of having to type the name of the server needed each time.
Put the files r_desktop.py, rdesktop.bat, and servers.txt in the same directory.
Put the devices you access regulary in the servers.txt file.
Run r_desktop.py and choose the device you want to connect to.
This program was designed to be ran on a windows OS
